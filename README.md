Took big inspiration from Nate (Stratascrath) to start this project. My goal for this project was to gain experience using API's to extract data and use for further analysis. 

The first step I took was to read the YouTube API documentation to understand what kind of data I could gather. Looking through the information sparked the idea to gather comments from a video and figure out the sentiment behind it. Then, I could give each video a score based on positive, negative or neutral sentiment. 

After having an idea of what I wanted for this project to look like, it was time to begin coding and learn. The first thing I did was use the YouTube API to gather the channel name, video title, and video ID.
